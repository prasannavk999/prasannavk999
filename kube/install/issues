Issues while settingup the cluster::

Error details:
=============

[kubelet-check] It seems like the kubelet isn't running or healthy.

Unfortunately, an error has occurred:
            timed out waiting for the condition

This error is likely caused by:
            - The kubelet is not running
            - The kubelet is unhealthy due to a misconfiguration of the node in some way (required cgroups disabled)
            - No internet connection is available so the kubelet cannot pull or find the following control plane images:
                - k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver-amd64:v1.11.2
                - k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager-amd64:v1.11.2
                - k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler-amd64:v1.11.2
                - k8s.gcr.io/etcd-amd64:3.2.18
                - You can check or miligate this in beforehand with "kubeadm config images pull" to make sure the images
                  are downloaded locally and cached.

        If you are on a systemd-powered system, you can try to troubleshoot the error with the following commands:
            - 'systemctl status kubelet'
            - 'journalctl -xeu kubelet'
            


Solution:
=========
sudo swapoff -a
sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^/#/' /etc/fstab

rebooted the instance.


I faced similar issue recently. The problem was cgroup driver. Kubernetes cgroup driver was set to systems but docker was set to systemd. So I created '/etc/docker/daemon.json' and added below:

{
"exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
}
Then

 systemctl daemon-reload
 systemctl restart docker
 systemctl restart kubelet
