Step1: Create security group to allow SSH (22) for EC2 instance.
Step2: Create security group (Inbound SG) which should allow NFS (2049) for EFS , source may be SG of EC2 instance.
Step3: Create Role for EC2 instance with Full Access to EFS.
Step4: Create EFS with maximum number of AZs.(EC2 instances should be within these AZs)
Step5: Create EC2 instances with above Role.


Mount EFS to EC2 instances using below steps.
#Create efs directory on both EC2 instances.
sudo mkdir efs

#Installing the amazon-efs-utils Package on Amazon Linux
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
