 	DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL key/value and document database.
 	Applications that contain large amounts of data but require predictable read and write performance
 	while scaling is a good fit for DynamoDB
 	DynamoDB scales with whatever read and write capacity you specific per second.
 	DynamoDB can be set to have Eventually Consistent Reads (default) and Strongly Consistent Reads
 	Eventually consistent reads data is returned immediately but data can be inconsistent. Copies of data
 	will be generally consistent in 1 second.
 	Strongly Consistent Reads will wait until data in consistent. Data will never be inconsistent but latency will be higher. Copies of data will be consistent with a guarantee of l second.
 	DynamoDB stores 3 copies of data on SSD drives across 3 regions.
