 	Data can be loaded from S3, EMR, DynamoDB, or multiple data sources on remote hosts.
 	Redshift is Columnar Store database which can SOL-like queries and is an OLAP.
 	Redshift can handle petabytes worth of data. Redshift is for Data Warehousing
 	Redshift most common use case is Business Intelligence
 	Redshift can only run in a 1 availability zone (Single-AZ)
 	Reshift can run via a single node or multi-node (clusters)
 	A single node is 160 GB in size
 	A multi-node is comprised of a leader node and multiple compute nodes
 	You are bill per hour for each node (excluding leader node in multi-node)
 	You are not billed for the leader node
 	You can have up to 128 compute nodes
 	Redshift has two kinds of Node Type Dense Compute and Dense Storage
 	Redshift attempts to backup 3 copies of your data, the original, on compute node and on S3
 	Similar data is stored on disk sequentially for faster reads
 	Redshift database can be encrypted via KMS or CloudHSM
 	Backup Retention is default to 1 day and can be increase to maximum of 35 days
 	Reshift can asynchronously back up your snapshot to Another Region delivered to S3
 	Redshift uses Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to distribute queries and data across all loads
 	In the case of empty table, when importing Redshift will sample data to create a schema.
