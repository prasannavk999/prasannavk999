5 IP Addresses are reserved for internal usage, first 4 + last 1 and  11 IPS will be available for use.

For every VPC one Route table created, this is main Route table and will take care of all traffic if there is no Route table created explicitly.
public route table get associated with public subnets and private route table get associated with private subnets.
One Sub net associate with one Route Table but one Route table can associate with more than one Sub nets.
IGW is an entity which allows traffic from VPC to Internet, only one IGW is connected to one VPC.

Nat Gate way and IGW are managed services and don't worry about the availability and scalability
